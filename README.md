# TimeSeries-Taxi_order_next_hour_prediction
In this project we are using Sweet Lift Taxi historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. We will build a model for such a prediction using time series data. The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.
